# Read energy utility meter with a simple IR dongle

In the beginning of this year my analogue ferraris energy counter was replaced with a [smart energy meter][1] by the electricity network operator. This made my previous [pulsemeter][2] project obsolete and I had to come up with something new. Luckily the [volksz채hler.org][3] project already supports reading many of the smartmeters available on the market and the wiki turned out be a great source of information. In the end, however, I didn't stick with the [vzlogger][4] software, but created my own smartmeter project from scratch.

The software stack consists of the following components:
- Smartmeter v0.3.1
- PostgreSQL 13.2 with TimescaleDB 2.2.1 and pg_cron 1.3.1 extenstions
- Mosquitto MQTT broker 2.0.10
- Node-RED 1.3.2
- Grafana 7.5.3

## Installation

Via Git:
```
git clone https://github.com/ahpohl/smartmeter.git
make
sudo make install
```
Or via Arch Linux package ([smartmeter][13]):
```
yaourt -S smartmeter mosquitto nodejs-node-red influxdb grafana-bin
```

Configuration and startup:
```
nano /etc/smartmeter.conf
systemctl enable smartmeter.service
systemctl start smartmeter.service
```
